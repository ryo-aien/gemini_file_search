The Gemini API provides powerful file search capabilities through its File Search feature.
This allows developers to build robust RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

Key Features:
- Upload and index documents
- Semantic search across documents
- Custom metadata filtering
- Configurable chunking strategies
- Support for multiple file formats

Use Cases:
1. Knowledge base search
2. Document Q&A systems

The File Search API handles document preprocessing, embedding generation, and
efficient vector search automatically, allowing developers to focus on their
application logic rather than infrastructure management.
